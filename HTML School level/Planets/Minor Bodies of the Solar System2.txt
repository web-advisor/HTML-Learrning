Asteroids are minor planets, especially those of the inner Solar System. The larger ones have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically
 been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not show the disc of a planet and was not observed to have the characteristics of an
 active comet.

A comet is an icy body that releases gas or dust. They are often compared to dirty snowballs, though recent research has led some scientists to call them
 snowy dirtballs. Comets contain dust, ice, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and more.
The first photographic discovery of a comet was made by Edward Emerson Barnard. By convention, comets are named after their discoverer or 
discoverers.

Shooting stars, or meteors, are bits of interplanetary material falling through Earth's atmosphere and heated to incandescence by friction.
 These objects are called meteoroids as they are hurtling through space, becoming meteors for the few seconds they streak across the sky and create 
glowing trails.
Meteorites may resemble Earth rocks, but they usually have a burned exterior. This fusion crust is formed as the meteorite is melted by friction as it 
passes through the atmosphere. There are three major types of meteorites: the "irons," the "stones," and the stony-irons.

Artificial satellites are human-built objects orbiting the Earth and other planets in the Solar System. This is different from the natural satellites, or moons,
 that orbit planets, dwarf planets and even asteroids. Artificial satellites are used to study the Earth, other planets, to help us communicate, and even to
 observe the distant Universe. Satellites can even have people in them, like the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle.
The first artificial satellite was the Soviet Sputnik 1 mission, launched in 1957.
