AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY
</font>
<br>
<p>
Agriculture and Industry are not exclusive of each other. They move hand in hand. The Agro-Industries in India have given a major boost to Agriculture
 by raising it's productivity. The Industries depend on Agriculture for raw materials and sell their products such as irrigation pumps, machines, Pipes, etc.

URBANISATION  AND INDUSTRY
</font>
<br>
<p>
Manufacturing tends to locate at the most appropriate place where all the factors of Industrial location are either available or can be arranged at lower cost.
After an Industrial activity starts, <u>Urbanisation</u> follows. Sometimes, Industries are located in or near the cities. Thus, Industrialisation and 
Urbanisation go hand in hand. Cities provide markets and also provide services such as banking, insurance, transport and financial advice, etc. to the 
Industry.
