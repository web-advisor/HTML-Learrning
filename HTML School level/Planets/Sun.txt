<p>
 THE SUN is our Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Sun releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic
 radiation peaking in visible light.The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. 
Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs,
 make up 85% of the stars in our Galaxy,The Milky Way.

The Sun dominates the Solar System, which accounts for almost 99.9% of the matter of the whole Solar System. Also, the Sun is the ultimate source of 
all the energy in the Solar System. 
</p>

<p>
The Sun is essentially a sphere of hot gases. The radius of Sun is 100 times the radius of the Earth and Sun's mass is 332,900 times Earth mass and the
Sun produces temperatures and densities in its core. All the energy Earth receives from the Sun is from Sun's 6000 Kelvin hot bright disc called 
Photosphere.
